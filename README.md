# Leaflet Playback

Leaflet Playback adds the ability to replay GPS tracks in the form of GeoJSON objects. Rather than simply animating a marker along a polyline, the speed of the animation is synchroized to a clock. The playback functionality is similar to a video player--you can start and stop playback, change the playback speed, load GPS tracks, as well as set the playback time with a slider or calendar/time-picker widget.
